# Rubocop

#### A Static Code Analyzer

This means, it is mainly used to enforce style rules for our ruby files/programs.
In rubocop speak:

- Cops

* Are rulesets

- Departments

* Are other sub-groupings of cops

Rubocop is a mix between a style formatter and a bit of code linting.
What are these?

### Style Formatting:

Style formatting is software that makes our code adhere to specific rules that make our
code more readable and focuses on aesthetic and appearance more.

The point of a style formatter is to make our code more consistent.
This can help us maintain a more predicatable appearance which can make it easier for ourselves and
others to read.

### Code Linting:

Does perform some style checks like a style formatter, but is more focused on looking for bug-prone code.
This can be software that detects un-assigned/empty variables, syntax errors, and typos and will give an error message
for the specfic things it finds.
