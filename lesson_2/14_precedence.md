# **Precedence**

"_operator precedence_"

These are a set of rules for Ruby to follow when evaluating an expression.
Which parts of this expression do I evaluate first?
It's the _precedence of operators in expressions in Ruby_

### 2 Main Terms to sort out:

1. **Operators**

> _Are symbols that tell Ruby to perform a specific set of operations on a/some value(s)._

_Example:_

```ruby
a + b

# The `+` in this expression is the operator

```

2. **Operand**

> _Are/is the value(s) that is/are being used in an operation, specified by an operator._

_Example:_

```ruby
a + b

# Where `a` and `b` in this expression are the operands

```
